	<description>Adds a childhood and puberty system to rimworld that I hope you enjoy.
		----
		What?
		- Successor to Age Matters to be used with WooHooer or Children, School and Families, or not.
		

		----
		Why?
		This is my follow up to Age Matters mod, this mod hopes to fill in the existing gaps with progeny and representation. 

		After playing with a few other mods I've found that the aging of humanlike pawns doesnt feel right enough to me.
		- Children are handled weakly, not considered or are a burden on the community for 12 years which is twice as long as a colony lasts me.
		- Puberty is terrible, that really should be accounted for.
		- there is no real system to give Pawns secondary sexual characteristics beyond just that Breast mod. Which makes physical representation of gender very unfortunately uninteresting.
		- Gender indeterminacy is allowed for in the Verse engine but not used except sparingly by other mods which limits easily reachable transgender representation and transitioning.
		- Possibility create eunuch cast; again with the Verse engine supporting non-binary gender. Because why not?


		----
		How this mod works?
		- Maturity - Adds a HeDiff by age called Youth that degrades away into Puberty before becoming a full fledged adult.
		- Sex Organs and Secondary Characteristics - Added body parts for groin, chest and reproductive organs.
		- Adds a patch to fleshy Humanlike species to get reproductive organs and secondary characteristics.

		----
		Goals?
		Alter RenderSize by age to slowly scale to pawns final height.


		----
		Notes

		This mod makes does not add click button WooHooing. If you would Like that please download my other mod Woohooer which I intended to be its partner.

		This Mod was designed to be compatible with the other mods that grants pregnancy to Pawns, such as my other mod WooHooer; or Children, School and Families.
		Without it your pawns get secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive organs to get shot off by raiders,

		This does not alter birth.
